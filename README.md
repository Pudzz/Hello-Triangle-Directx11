# Hello-Triangle-Directx11
The first assignment done during the course "3D Programming" in school.

## Assignment
- Create two triangles to create a rectangle
- Texture this rectangle
- Perform a simple transformation using matrices
- Add a diffuse light [Point light]

### Demo
First program in Direct3D that I wrote, so everything is like a lump in main.cpp, and a lot of comments find to learn.
